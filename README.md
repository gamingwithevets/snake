# About
Snake, made in 100% Python.
It uses the Curses library to display color.

# System requirements
For Windows:
You need Python 3.6 - *3.9.9* and Windows 7+ (Windows 8+ for Python 3.9) with the *windows-curses* package installed.<br>
Now, you may be wondering, "Why not Python 3.10 instead? That's the newest version!"
And you're right. But, as of 2021, no Curses library has been made for 3.10, and so, using pip to install *windows-curses*... is pretty much impossible. You can read more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69927587/python-curses-module-for-windows-cant-install).
  
For Mac:
*Please note, I have never installed Python on a Mac before, so please correct anything wrong!*
You need Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard to 10.9 Mavericks and above, depending on what the description says, to install Python.
Again, you need Python 3.6 - *3.9.9* as well.

For Linux:
Ubuntu 20.04 happens to have Python 3.8 installed along with the Curses library.
If you didn't uninstall the Curses library or Python, you're all good to go!

# Python requirements
- Python 3.6 - *3.9.9* (DO NOT USE 3.10)
- The Curses library (either use *windows-curses* or some other Curses package)
